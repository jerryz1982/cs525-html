However, with burglaries in the neighborhood, how can you get a peace of mind when you are at work?
<p>PiGuard&#8482; is an open source solution to battle the problem. It employs the credit card sized Raspberry Pi
as a smart agent to collect various types of sensor data of your home and reports security events matching
a crime signature to a central management console, with which you can see what is going on in the home and
catch the images of the bad guy. It will give you immediate alerts through Email, SMS and social media
messages such as twitter or facebook. You can take appropiate actions for the event by a click on the console,
which you can visit at home or everywhere else in the world as long as internet is available.

to RabbitMQ message broker. The central management control console, which employs MEAN(<dfn>MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, NodeJs</dfn>)
stack, can display and let user handle the reported events with a couple of clicks.</p>
