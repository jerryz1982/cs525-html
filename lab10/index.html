<h2>Long-term Goal</h2>
<p>
My long-term goal is to become an expert on cloud networking technologies.
</p>
<aside class="box3">
Steve Jobs once said back in 1997:
  <blockquote>
  I don’t need a hard disk in my computer if I can get to the server faster…
  carrying around these non-connected computers is byzantine by comparison.
  </blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My current internship is to integrate a networking hardware device with the open source cloud technology, namely OpenStack.
The challenges I am facing now are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Need more understanding of the networking protocols.</li>
  <li>Need more knowledge of the product and its specifications.</li>
  <li>Require architectual perspective in software design.</li>
</ol>
<p>To solve those challenges, I will work hard to master routing procotols, product specifications and apply the knowledge in everyday work.
Moreover, learn from mature implementation regarding its achitecuture design.</p>
