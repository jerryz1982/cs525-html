<h2>LeBron, Cavaliers bring trophy home to Cleveland</h2>
<p>The Cavs overcame a 3-1 deficit to defeat the Golden State Warriors in seven games, ending Cleveland's pro sports title drought stretching to 1964.
</p>
<p>
James, the four-time MVP, paraded the trophy around the perimeter of the parking lot so fans behind the chain-linked fences could see they weren't dreaming.</p>

<p>It has been an disappointing yet exciting night for Warriors fans. The Warriors had lost
2 title points since their 3:1 lead over the Cavaliers. Game 6 was controversial because referee
had been acting weird, so I had expected that Warroirs could have seize the last opportunity at home.
They indeed worked hard tonight as they had made 11 ties and 21 lead changes.</p>
<p>I had to admit that Lebron was the more thirsty to bring the title to Cleveland, which hasn't seen one in the past 42 years.
The Cavaliers did a better job and more lucky in the end. Congratuate to Lebron anyway because he deserves it.</p>
